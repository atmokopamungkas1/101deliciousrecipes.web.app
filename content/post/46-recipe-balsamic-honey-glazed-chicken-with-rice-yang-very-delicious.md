Use organic boneless skinless chicken breasts if possible. Not only do they taste incredible but they are SO much better for you. Local wildflower honey is best, but clover honey will work well, too. In a small bowl, whisk together the balsamic vinegar, honey, olive oil, garlic (or ginger), seasoning, salt, and pepper.
