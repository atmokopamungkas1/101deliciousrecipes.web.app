The goal is to ensure that the center of the fries are fully cooked before the outsides get too brown. Work in batches if you&#39;re making more than one or two potatoes&#39; worth. Adding too many fries at one time will bring down the temperature of the oil and cause soggy fries. Wash potatoes and cut potatoes into thin fries (I prefer Â¼&#34; thick). You can also use a French fry cutter for even fries.
