When the lobster is cool enough to handle, remove the shell and cut into large chunks. Turn the heat to medium-high and add the chopped onions. Paella is a traditional Spanish dish with saffron-flavored rice topped with seafood, meat and/or vegetables and served in a shallow paella pan. Fregola, the pearl-size Sardinian pasta that is quite similar to Israeli couscous, makes a terrific substitute for rice in this paella-style dish; it soaks up a lot of the cooking.
