##### Steps to make Vegetarian Niçoise Salad:


1. Ready to serve and ENJOY!

I like to leave the skin on because there&#39;s lots of nutrients concentrated in the skin, but that&#39;s totally up to you. Throw the taters into a pot of salted water, and simmer until tender. In the last minute or two of cook time for the potatoes, throw the green beans in with them. The romaine base is tossed in said heavenly dressing, then topped with potatoes roasted in the same oil/herb/seasoning blend, creamy white beans, hearts of palm, blanched green beans, mini heirloom tomatoes and olives. Traditional Nicoise contains tuna and eggs, which we&#39;ve replaced here with hearts of palm &amp; white beans.
