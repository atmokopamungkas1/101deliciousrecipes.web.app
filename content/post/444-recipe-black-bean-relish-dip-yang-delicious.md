Amy&#39;s Kitchen - Black Bean Dip This is a delicious black bean dip with sautéed garlic, lime juice and a lively blend of cumin and smoked paprika. Goes well with crudité or crackers. Notice that I leave the garlic in fairly large chunks; if you chop it too finely, it will burn. Combine the beans with onion mixture, salt, cumin, lime juice, water, and fresh cilantro in a blender or food processor. Use it as a dip with tortilla chips or spoon it over grilled chicken, pork, fish &amp; seafood like a chunky black bean salsa.
