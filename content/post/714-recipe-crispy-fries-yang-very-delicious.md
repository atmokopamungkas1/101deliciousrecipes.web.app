##### The ingredients needed to make Crispy fries:

1. Get 2 pinches salt
1. Make ready 2 pinches black pepper

In this recipe, we precook the potatoes and let them cool to room temperature before they hit the buttered pan, ensuring perfectly crusty and crispy edges. Tossing your potato cubes in a sufficient amount of a neutral-flavored oil, like vegetable or canola, and then seasoning them with whatever spices you like (I always go for smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, and dried oregano, plus salt and pepper) is the best way to achieve crispy, flavorful potatoes. Parboiling the fries in a vinegar solution before frying slows the breakdown of pectin in the potatoes to yield fries with tiny, bubbly, blistered surfaces that stay crisp even when cool. It also rinses off excess sugars to prevent over-browning.
