Hey everyone, it's Drew, welcome to our recipe site. Today, I'm gonna show you how to prepare a special dish, avocado benny. One of my favorites. For mine, I am going to make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Avocado Benny is one of the most well liked of recent trending foods in the world. It is easy, it is fast, it tastes yummy. It is appreciated by millions daily. They are fine and they look fantastic. Avocado Benny is something that I've loved my entire life.

Stream hot butter into the egg mixture a little at a time while you run the immersion blender, letting the hot butter cook the eggs and blending until hollandaise is light and fluffy and all butter has been incorporated. Add a few slices of avocado to the hollandaise - I like to use about Â¼ of the total avocado - and blend until smooth. Avo Benny It&#39;s all in the sauce. Here I turn the basic creamy Hollandaise into something completely unexpected using black salt, kala namak, for the egginess that is expected with a benedict.
