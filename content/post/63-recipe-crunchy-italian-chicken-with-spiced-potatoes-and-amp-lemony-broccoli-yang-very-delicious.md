I call it an Italian Chicken Casserole because it&#39;s stew-like, with plenty of sauce to slop up with crusty bread or to toss through pasta. Brush all the salt off the chicken. Place the chicken on top of the potatoes (breast side down to start) then pop the tray into the oven. Cut the chicken into pieces and dry each piece very well with a paper towel.
