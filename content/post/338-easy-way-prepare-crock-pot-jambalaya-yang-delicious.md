##### Steps to make Crock Pot Jambalaya:


1. Ready to serve and ENJOY!

Prep it, add it to the slow cooker, and then mostly forget it. The inclusion of converted (parboiled) rice (instead of the more traditional regular long-grain rice) makes this jamblaya easier than most. Since Mardi Gras is just around the corner, my belly has been craving all those wonderful New Orleans foods. It&#39;s a southern favorite that does really well in a slow cooker. By starting to cook hours before it&#39;s time to serve the jambalaya, the rice will slowly absorb seasoned chicken broth and fluff up beautifully in the end.
