Pro tip: Use freshly crushed pepper and freshly squeezed coconut milk to enhance the taste. The duck is seasoned and marinated with a classic Caribbean curry marinade, then cooked over an open wood fire for enhanced flavor. I used skinless breast meat here. If you want to use skin-on, sear the skin side of the duck breast until it&#39;s crispy and set aside; don&#39;t cook the meat side.
