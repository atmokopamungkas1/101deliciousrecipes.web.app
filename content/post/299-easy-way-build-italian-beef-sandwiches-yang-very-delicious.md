Hey everyone, hope you are having an amazing day today. Today, I will show you a way to prepare a special dish, italian beef sandwiches. It is one of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a little bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Italian Beef is chuck roast (the cut of meat used for pot roast) that is slowly cooked with savory Italian spices until it is soft and tender and easily shredded with a fork. To create the iconic sandwich, soft hoagie rolls are filled with this shredded meat, and then topped with sliced provolone and pickled peppers. Top each sandwich with some beef and jus, and a layer of provolone over the top. Broil just to melt the cheese (don&#39;t overdo it, or it can make your meat tough and the roll too dry; the roll should stay soft but be slightly warm).
