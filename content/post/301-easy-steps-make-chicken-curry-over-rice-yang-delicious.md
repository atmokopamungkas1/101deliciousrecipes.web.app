The best way is to cut each breast in half lengthwise, then slice on the diagonal. Don&#39;t make yourself crazy over it, but try to make each piece about the same size; this ensures that they cook evenly. Next, season the chicken with salt, pepper and curry powder. I would call this recipe a medium-hot dish.

Next, season the chicken with salt, pepper and curry powder. I would call this recipe a medium-hot dish. I put in quite a bit of curry, but there is a lot of rice and chicken for it to cover. Add the chicken and cook, stirring frequently, until it&#39;s no longer pink on the outside. If the onions are getting too brown, reduce the heat to medium low temporarily.
