Turtles are protected, so I use oxtail or beefshanks, which you can buy year round frozen in supermarkets here. Our famous oxtail is stewed for hours in order to soften tender cuts of beef. The softened beef cut is then tossed along with our slowly simmered broth mixed with onions, carrots, peppers, celery, garlic, and chopped tomatoes. Oxtail soup, made with simple ingredients and a long slow simmer, is one of those good old-time comfort soups that are extra special in the cold winter months.
