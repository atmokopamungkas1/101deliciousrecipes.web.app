##### Instructions to make Bread and Soup in Memory of my Mother:


1. Ready to serve and ENJOY!

The word &#34;honor&#34; means to esteem, to revere, to value, or to venerate. My mother was a very good cook - and she was adventurous in her culinary efforts. I remember the time she made biscuit tortoni, a delicious Italian ice cream dessert with amaretti cookies and cherries on top, and the time she made sauerbraten and red cabbage - all delicious accomplishments for a young woman from Lynchburg Virginia. The meal always started with homemade soup — krupnik a barley soup with diced potatoes, carrots and meat — chicken broth simmered on the stove for several hours with kluski made from cornmeal. In Memory Of My Mother by Patrick Kavanagh I do not think of you lying in the wet clay Of a Monaghan graveyard; I see You walking down a lane among the poplars On your way to the station, or happily Going to second Mass on a summer Sunday-- You meet me and you say: &#39;Don&#39;t forget to see about the cattle--&#39; Among your earthiest words the angels. &#34;Bread on my Mother&#39;s Table&#34; also recounts the joy that a move to Chicago brought about, and warmly (and sometimes humorously) shares the personal habits often characteristic of ethnic Germans in that part of the world.
