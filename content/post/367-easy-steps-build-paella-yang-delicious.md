When the lobster is cool enough to handle, remove the shell and cut into large chunks. Turn the heat to medium-high and add the chopped onions. Fregola, the pearl-size Sardinian pasta that is quite similar to Israeli couscous, makes a terrific substitute for rice in this paella-style dish; it soaks up a lot of the cooking. Stir in uncooked rice, tomatoes, bay leaves, salt, oregano, and turmeric.
